# Integrations

Evidently can be easily integrated with other tools to fit into the existing workflows.&#x20;

Below are a few specific examples of how to integrate Evidently in the prediction pipelines. You can adapt them for other workflow management, visualization, and tracking tools.

## 1. Real-time ML monitoring with Grafana

[evidently-+-grafana.md](evidently-+-grafana.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## 2. Batch ML monitoring with Airflow

{% content-ref url="evidently-+-airflow.md" %}
[evidently-+-airflow.md](evidently-+-airflow.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
