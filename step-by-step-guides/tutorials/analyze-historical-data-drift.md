# Analyze historical data drift

**TL;DR:** You can use Evidently to evaluate drift in your training data. Understanding past data changes helps define monitoring and retraining strategy. Here is a [sample Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/evidentlyai/evidently/blob/main/evidently/tutorials/historical\_drift\_visualization.ipynb).

## Tutorial - "How to detect, evaluate and visualize historical drifts"

In this tutorial, we check historical drift on a month-by-month basis. We add a custom function to set drift conditions on the dataset level. We use Evidently **Data Drift Profile** to calculate drift, Plotly to generate custom visuals, and integrate with Mlflow to log the results.
